# Visual Data Analysis of Fraudulent TransactionsÂ¶

# Your CFO has also requested detailed trends data on specific card holders. 
# Use the starter notebook to query your database and generate visualizations 
# that supply the requested information as follows, then add your 
# visualizations and observations to your markdown report.

#%%

# Initial imports
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from datetime import datetime
import pandas as pd
import pathlib
import hvplot.pandas
import psycopg2
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

#%%

# Create a connection to the database
# engine = create_engine("postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/fraud_detection")

# Load .env enviroment variables
home = pathlib.Path.home() / ".env"  # for pc 1/2
load_dotenv(dotenv_path=home)  # for pc 2/2


# Set sqlalchemy connection
conn_str_main = os.getenv("conn_str_main")
database = "Unit 7 HW SQL Susp Trns_"

# Define the database URL
db_url = conn_str_main+database

# Create the engine object
engine = create_engine(db_url)

#%%

# look at card-holder data
# Write the SQL query
query = "SELECT * FROM card_holder"

# Read the SQL query into a DataFrame
card_holder_df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# Show the DataFrame's head
print(card_holder_df)

#%%

# look at credit card data
# Write the SQL query
query = "SELECT * FROM credit_cards"

# Read the SQL query into a DataFrame
credit_cards_df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# Show the DataFrame's head
print(credit_cards_df)

#%%

# look at merchant-category data
# Write the SQL query
query = "SELECT * FROM merchant_cat"

# Read the SQL query into a DataFrame
merchant_cat_df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# Show the DataFrame's head

#%%

# look at merchants data
# Write the SQL query
query = "SELECT * FROM merchants"

# Read the SQL query into a DataFrame

# look at transactions data
# Write the SQL query
query = "SELECT * FROM transactions"

# Read the SQL query into a DataFrame
transactions = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# Show the DataFrame's head
print(transactions)

#%%

# look at transactions data
# Write the SQL query

# Read the SQL query into a DataFrame

#%%

# Data Analysis Question 1

# The two most important customers of the firm may have been hacked. 
# Verify if there are any fraudulent transactions in their history. 
# For privacy reasons, you only know that their cardholder IDs are 2 and 18.

# Using hvPlot, create a line plot representing the time series of 
# transactions over the course of the year for each cardholder separately.

# Next, to better compare their patterns, create a single line plot 
# that containins both card holders' trend data.

# What difference do you observe between the consumption patterns? 
# Does the difference suggest a fraudulent transaction? 
# Explain your rationale in the markdown report.
